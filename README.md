# A$AP Rocky Releases Previously Leaked Song “Taylor Swif”


### Don’t worry—it’s not really about Taylor Swift.


__A$AP Rocky__’s long-awaited album __DON‘T BE DUMB__ was supposed to drop today, but it’s been __pushed back__ to the fall. On the bright side, Rocky has given us a new single, __“Taylor Swif,”__ though it’s actually a track that’s been kicking around since at least 2022, when he gave it a __debut airing__ at Rolling Loud Portugal. It leaked soon after, but now we now have the official version, a hyper-confident [Hitkidd](https://genius.com/artists/Hitkidd)-produced trap banger whose title is designed to raise some eyebrows.


In the first verse, Rocky plays on ex/X while seemingly referencing Malcolm X and the _’90s sitcom Malcolm & Eddie_.


```
Shoot my shot, got her wet (Hoo)
Bet that’s all neck, girl, that’s wetty
Ready, gave me all neck, how beheading
Ready, might just sign my ex-girl, no Malcolm and Eddie, already
```
